# AddressBook
Hello all!

I have archived the old readme file and I am creating this new version! I wanted to post a bit of an update as to what I am working on right now! I am currently re-writing the front end of the person object! I also plan on re-writing the front end of the rest of the objects as well but I will release version 2.0 after re-writing the person frontend! I am going to be focusing on bug fixing and optimizing for speed and reduce the amount of querys to the server! After version 2.0 is published I will focus on optimizations and publish subsiquent updates as needed!

Update!! Version 2.0 is finished!!!! I still need to do some bug testing and adding comments to the program before I feel ready to add the source code and the final version of the jar to my github page! I will post version 2.0 this weekend! If I'm lucky I might also have re-written the address and occupation frontend with optimization in place. We shall see about that that!

Update Again!! I am not going to be uploading the version 2.0 this weekend. I found some bugs in the backend that need to be fixed before publishing! The plan right now is that it will be released when its done no idea when that is I want this version to be a stable version! Sorry for the inconvenience 

Final update before release!! I have fixed a bug in the backend with updating people. I will be making sure the bug isnt found in other aspects of the program. I am also going to be adding comments to the program and cleaning up the code. I will relase version 2.0 this week!!
