ATTENTION!!!!!
Today around 2:30 CDT the mysql server will be taken offline for several hours! I am going to consolidating my servers. I am hoping to have the mySQL server back up around 8:00 PM CDT at the latest! All data on the server will be deleted!

Setup:
1. Create mySQL server
2. Change the IP`s, yes both, to you internal and or external IP
3. Change user and pass to your mySQL user username and password
4. In encryption create two diffrent random strings have to be 8 characters longs 

How to use:
1. Run program in command prompt
2. Use one or two for which IP you want
3. Select which table
4. Select which method
5. Repeat until done

Encryption UPDATE!!!
I have disabled the encryption part of the program for the time being!
I posted this update to fix some bugs and imporve performace with the program!
I will eventually post an updated version of the program with encryption!

Any other questions tweet me on twitter @jackstockley_ and Ill add it here
