 ## How to Set Up your own server!
  If you want to use your own server then this program has that ability!
  To start you will need to setup a MySQL server and a database.
  Then create 3 tables one for address, occupation and person!
  I will release the scripts that I use to setup my server once I finish creating them!
  
 ## How to use my server!
  At this time there is no easy way to use my server unless you want to edit the addressBook.java file and enable testing!
  I plan on releasing a second .jar file with this defaulted!
