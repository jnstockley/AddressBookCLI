Hello all!

I have arhived the old readme file and I am creating this new version! I wanted to post a bit of an update as to what I am working on right now! I am currently re-writing the front end of the person object! I also plan on re-writing the front end of the rest of the objects as well. I am going to be focusing on bug fixing and optimizing for speed and reduce the amount of querys to the server! The next version I publish will be version 2.0! Be on the lookout for the next version! Current ETA could still change but I'm hoping worst case senario 3-weeks!
