# AddressBook
Hello all!

I have archived the old readme file and I am creating this new version! I wanted to post a bit of an update as to what I am working on right now! I am currently re-writing the front end of the person object! I also plan on re-writing the front end of the rest of the objects as well but I will release version 2.0 after re-writing the person frontend! I am going to be focusing on bug fixing and optimizing for speed and reduce the amount of querys to the server! After version 2.0 is published I will focus on optimizations and publish subsiquent updates as needed!

Update!! Version 2.0 is finished!!!! I still need to do some bug testing and adding comments to the program before I feel ready to add the source code and the final version of the jar to my github page! I will post version 2.0 this weekend! If I'm lucky I might also have re-written the address and occupation frontend with optimization in place. We shall see about that that!
